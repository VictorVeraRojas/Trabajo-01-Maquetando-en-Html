    <h3>Work experience</h3>
    <ul style="width: 70%;">
      <li><p style="text-align: justify;">During the holiday season I usually go to work at a balloon printing company, in this company they have different sizes and shapes of balloons which employees must engrave with a type of engraving already established. All employees have a "goal" of work which is represented in kilos of balloons made and when exceeding a defined amount is received an extra payment.</p></li>
      <li><p style="text-align: justify;">I was working as a secretary in a high school where my main function was the administration of a whole grade in general, the tasks I developed were to pass grades to the report card in addition to uploading them to the SEJ system, I made justifications for students, keeping track of their attendance, in addition to distributing important notices given by the principal or any other authority to the entire high school.</p></li>
      <li><p style="text-align: justify;">I worked for a while in Escudo Urbano C5 where I did my professional practices, where my main job was to document systems that were already developed, as well as to propose new interfaces for their portals or pages that they already had established.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Project experience</h3>
    <ul style="width: 70%;">
      <li><p style="text-align: justify;">I developed a system together with other colleagues, this system was based on the high school where I was previously. The function of the system was to show the students material from reliable sources and validated by the teachers, this material went from the first semester to the eighth. The system had its own database, login to know who logged in, as well as a responsive system. This system was public since we had acquired a domain and a host to host our system.</p></li>
      <li><p style="text-align: justify;">I worked on another project where the system was focused on a hospital. This system could schedule appointments, register doctors, register patients, as well as modify them. It had a login system to identify the type of user that was accessing and show its interface.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Professional interests</h3>
    <ul style="width: 70%;">
      <li><p style="text-align: justify;">I always like to be aware of new hardware components and their processing power among other things.</p></li>
      <li><p style="text-align: justify;">Be aware of new technologies or tools for live transmissions. </p></li>
      <li><p style="text-align: justify;">I also like to see about overclocking as well as practicing it but at a lower frequency on my system.</p></li>
    </ul>
